# Rust prototype

## Discussion
# Cons
- Unknowns, e.g. middlewares
- Will probably take longer


# Pro
- People are excited about it
- Chance to gain knowledge
- Safety features (static typing, strict compiler)

## Worked well

- Project setup, stuff just works
- Proper concurrency (`tokio` has awesome docs: https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial)
- Didn't feel less productive


## Still unclear
- Error handling
- web3 middlewares like retry, POS chain support
- How to test? Mayeb ganache chain
